# Image Gallery 

 

####This is an application where you can see various images in a gallery. Only 3 images are displayed at a given point of time. Image can be filtered according to their sub types. Sub types can be viewed in the drop-down. Details of each image can be viewed by clicking that particular image.  Navigation between different images is possible by clicking next and previous buttons. 

 

##Design summary 

	####Ideally, one would expose a Web API end point that takes a start index that returns some JSON objects (three in this case). I intend to host this on github.io, and that currently does not support C# API endpoints. Due to that constraint, I am loading the entire contents of the JSON file and using it as my data source. 

 

##Tools/frameworks used
